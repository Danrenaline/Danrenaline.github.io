## Hello there wanderer!


You've successfully found my pocket dimension where I reside and contemplate on the sophistication of metalic systems and how to break them. 

I do this by practicing various CTFs in order to, hopefully, one day persue a career in cybersecurity. But most important of all is that doing CTFs (and learning about computers in general) makes me truly feel quite happy and so that's why I'm here.


## What's to be expected...


If you do decide to explore this pocket dimension, be on the look out for writeups to a bunch of CTFs that I've completed over the course of my journey. These CTFs vary in difficulty so there is probably something for everyone.
