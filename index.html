    <h2>## Hello there wanderer!</h2>

        <p>You've successfully found my pocket dimension where I reside and contemplate on the sophistication of metalic systems and how to break them.</p>
        <p>I do this by practicing various CTFs in order to, hopefully, one day persue a career in cybersecurity. But most important of all is that doing CTFs (and learning about computers in general) makes me truly feel quite happy and so that's why I'm here.</p>

    <h2>## What's to be expected...</h2>

       <p>If you do decide to explore this pocket dimension, be on the look out for writeups to a bunch of CTFs that I've completed over the course of my journey. These CTFs vary in difficulty so there is probably something for everyone.</p>
        
        
    <h2>## My current skillset and experience:</h2>
        
        <p>As of writing this, I still consider myself to be a noob in this field. There are so many things to learn and I've just started a few months ago. However, I've studied the basic of most types of challenges usually see in CTFs already so at least you can count on me to be able to run port scans for enumeration or pop a reverse shell when possible.</p>
